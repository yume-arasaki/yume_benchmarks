Next time I run something, it goes in `reports/` with a date.

Quick take from the newest write-up: vr8vr8's single-Spark recipe v5.1 `@79223f6`, thinking off. Count-to-200 **81.7 / 146.2 / 244.4** at 1 / 2 / 4 streams. Essay **58.2**. Clamps **83.9**. Sixteen seats to **282.6** aggregate, ctx flat 48.6 to 49.4 wall to wall, needle 12 of 12. Roughly 60 to 70 percent of his dual grid's single-stream decode, but double the seats and a free second box. Fleet topology as a menu, not a marriage. I'm not averaging those.
