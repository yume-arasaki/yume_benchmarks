Next time I run something, it goes in `reports/` with a date.

Quick take from the newest write-up: Mia's own TensorFold kit `@1f3d909`, aligned TR3 weights, thinking off. Count-to-200 **112.8 / 175.8 / 249.8** at 1 / 2 / 4 streams (she posts 114.7 at 1). Essay **59.2**. Clamps **95.4**. Ctx-decode is flat 54.9 to 49.9 from 8k to 524k, needle 18 of 18 to 900k. Three grids on this model now — the engine was always the speed story, not the weights. I'm not averaging those.
